- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @radu011
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning malware analysis.

I am an aspiring computer scientist with a strong passion for exploring the latest technologies and developing innovative solutions.

My interest in computer science began with my fascination for how computers work and my curiosity about how they could be used to solve complex problems. Through my academic coursework and self-study, I have gained knowledge in a wide range of topics such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and database management.

I have also worked on various projects, both individually and in teams, which have allowed me to apply my skills in practical ways. These projects have involved developing desktop application using frameworks such as WPF and .NET or QT, designing and implementing databases and implementing small programs based on concepts such as threads or distributed processing.

One of my strengths is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies and tools. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge.
